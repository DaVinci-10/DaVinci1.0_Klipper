# This printer config was written by DaVinci10 on Klipper Discord(s) and can be reached there. Feel free to DM on either platform.
# To keep printer.cfg from being a mile long, the priner config file is included [include DaVinci_1_0_printer.cfg] in printer.cfg 
# printer.cfg has the Auto-Save area and [include]'s for additional features.
# This cfg is intended for a Xyz Printing Inc. DaVinci 1.0 3dPrinter. (not for 1.0A, 2.0, 2.0a, or AIO)

# I prefer not to enable this, but we need to in order to manually prevent z down crash.
# With z-hop enabled every home attmpt drops bed 10mm.
# Combined home efforts with phase errors can lead to bed being extremly low.
