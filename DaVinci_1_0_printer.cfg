# This printer config was written by DaVinci10 on Klipper Discord(s) and can be reached there. Feel free to DM on either platform.
# To keep printer.cfg from being a mile long, this config file is included [include DaVinci_1_0_printer.cfg] in printer.cfg 
# printer.cfg has the Auto-Save area and [include]'s for additional features.
# This cfg is intended for a Xyz Printing Inc. DaVinci 1.0 3dPrinter. (not for 1.0A, 2.0, 2.0a, or AIO)
# The stock DaVinci used standard linear-rod motion system.
# SAFETY WARNING: The thermistors on the DaVinci have custom definintion in this config. They seem to be working but are not 100% verified.
# These were hand built so please be careful and if you have a temperature probe availible to assist in verification please let me know.
# So far, so good. But to reiterate this is not for 1.0A, 2.0, 2.0A, or AiO printers. If anyone needs help trying to modify for those please let me know.

# GPIO startup pins includes heaters and motors are forced off at boot, before Klipper has taken control. 
# If gpio pins at startup is used, a Firmware-Reset will will clear phase errors by forcing stepper driver counts to be cleared from mcu. see phase tracking
# The DaVinci have NEMA17 1.8* stepper motors and A4988 drivers,
# X and Y use 2mm belts and 20 tooth pulleys; 
# X and Extruder motors use a 42-42 0.9a
# Y and Z axis uses a NEMA17 42-48 1.0a
# Z Motor drives an M8 Threaded Rod single start and has a resolution of 1.25mm/full turn, 0.00625mm full_step, and 0.000390625mm @16 micro_steps.
# The Extruder is a direct drive hobbed gear with integrated optical filament runout and opto-mechanical motion sensor.
# The optical filament runout sensor detects end of filament before it gets to the drive gear causing a jam.
# This can auto-pause the print and allow a new spool filament to be loaded thereby saving the print.
# The runout sensor is set to default enabled: but may be disabled to help with transparent/translucent filaments that are hard to detect with an optical sensor.
# The optical filament motion sensor opto-mechanicaly detects movement in the extruder/idler gear train.
# The ability to determine filament width using this detector may be of value but yet to be setup in klipper.
# It is intended to detect filament slowing down from width issues, slipping/grinding due to incorect temps, and full on extruder jams (default enabled: but can be disabled)
# The LCD is a WINStar 1604 and is not yet operational in this config. I believe its a hd47780 init and/or a font issue. further work was done by others as well.
# Stock extruder [200 steps/rot]*[16 steps]/[99 steps/mm] 32.3232mm rotation_distance
# Stock xy_steppers [200 steps/rot]*[16 steps]/[80 steps/mm] 40mm rotation_distance
# Stock z_stepper [200 steps/rot]*[16 steps]/[2560 steps/mm] 1.25mm rotation_distance (this is an M8 single-start threaded rod)
# Stock 1.0 has the purge bucket and wiper in a slot to the right of and behind the z rod holder bracket. a Slot if you will. 
# This can lead to toolhead crash if both x and y are homed and a -x move of more than a few mm. 
# So beware and use a safe_home spot forward of this bracket. Also make sure you home Y before X in all cases.
# May work on a homing_override to enhance this and try and prevent moves that can crash the toolhead. 
# I began work on a purge and wipe macros, but they are not ready for primetime. If your willing to helpout please let me know.
# safe_home sets Y at 206 so first X move isnt in danger of crashing into upper Z bracket. But sits forward of purge bucket/wiper.

## when True set optimum layer height in slicer(s) to 0.00625mm increments to sync layers to full steps 1.25/200
## 0.20mm is good standard layers, but for example use 0.25mm (not 0.24) to utilize full stepping.
## set optimum Z moves for zhop and retracts and probe moves to sync to full steps.
## Set optimum first layer height to 0.250mm and 0.20 for other layers. 
## Min layer height I've found is 0.15mm but I've been down to 0.1mm or less successfully in variable layer height.
## I've gone to a "full turn" Z hop in slicer at 1.25mm on all layers above 0.1mm up to 198mm, this avoids nozzle probe digging in especially during travel moves.
