This printer config was written by DaVinci10 on Klipper Discord(s) and can be reached there. Feel free to DM on either platform.
To keep printer.cfg from being a mile long, the actual priner config file is included [include DaVinci_1_0_printer.cfg] in printer.cfg 
 printer.cfg has the Auto-Save area and [include]'s for additional features.
This cfg is intended for a Xyz Printing Inc. DaVinci 1.0 3dPrinter. (not for 1.0A, 2.0, 2.0a, or AIO)
