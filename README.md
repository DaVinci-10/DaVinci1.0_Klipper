This printer config was written by DaVinci10 on Klipper Discord(s) and can be reached there. Feel free to DM on either platform.
This cfg is intended for a Xyz Printing Inc. DaVinci 1.0 3dPrinter. (not for 1.0A, 2.0, 2.0a, or AIO)

*Notes: The Axis Corrdinate System has been reversed to conform to industry norm. 
This makes 0x, 0y located @front-left of the build plate.

To keep printer.cfg from being a mile long, the actual printer config file is included [include DaVinci_1_0_printer.cfg] in printer.cfg 

printer.cfg has the Auto-Save area along with [include]'s for additional features.

Files are in config folder
I placed my other board config files in here as well, such as the sht36 toolhead pcb. 
As they are commented out in the printer.cfg they wont load. But since they are documented there, figured I may as well have the files available to view for users.
Live Long and Prosper!
